        Known for his dazzling charm, rapier wit, and unrivaled humility,
        Michael is the creator of the
        <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails
        Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
        <a href="https://learnenough.com/">
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> introductory sequence. Michael
        is also notorious as the founder of
        <a href="http://tauday.com/">Tau Day</a> and author of
        <a href="http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto"><em>The Tau
        Manifesto</em></a>, but rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
        are slightly exaggerated.

          When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder 
          stashes on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer 
          designing interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some 
          of the interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

        You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
        Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd 
        at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a 
        tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.

        Hostel Review as the name goes is a <em>hostel review website</em> 
        created with the intention of helping university students make the 
        right choice when trying to pick a home where they intend to spend 
        their university years.
      </p>
      <p>
        we believe there are <strong>at least a bilion students</strong> who 
        can benefit from living in a coducive environment, probably more. 
        If you would like to extend the branch of Hostel Review &ndash; as we 
        currently cover only Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Anambra State 
        &ndash; feel free to 
        <a href="https://hostelreview.com/#email_list">email us.</a>
